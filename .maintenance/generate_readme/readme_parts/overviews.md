## adsorbate_depositor
The `adsorbate_depositor` project is a Python-based tool designed for generating atomic structures with adsorbates deposited on substrate surfaces. It is especially useful for researchers and engineers who work on surface science, catalysis, or computational materials science. This project aims to streamline the process of preparing complex atomic structures for simulation.

## vasp/general
The `vasp_cleanup.py` script is a Python utility designed to clean up unnecessary VASP (Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package) output files in a given directory. The script retains essential input files like `INCAR`, `POSCAR`, `POTCAR`, and `KPOINTS`, along with the job submission script (default is `script.sh`). All other standard VASP output files are moved to a backup directory for safekeeping.

## vasp/poscar
Overview not found in scripts/vasp/poscar/README.md.

## vasp/potcar
This script is designed to generate a POTCAR file used in VASP calculations by reading elements from a POSCAR file and concatenating the corresponding POTCAR files from a given library.

## vasp/kpoints
This Python script generates a regular KPOINTS file for VASP calculations. The user specifies the number of k-points along each of the three axes (`a`, `b`, `c`). They can also choose between a Gamma-centered or Monkhorst-Pack mesh type.
