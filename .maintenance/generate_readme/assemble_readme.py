    This class provides a way to dynamically generate a README.md file by
    concatenating individual markdown sections specified in a YAML recipe file.
    The recipe file defines the order and source files for each section to be
    included in the final README.md.

    Attributes:
        recipe (list): A list of dictionaries, each containing information about
                       a section to be included in the README.md.

    Methods:
        __init__(recipe_file: Path): Initialize ReadmeGenerator with a recipe file.
        _parse_recipe(recipe_file_path: Path): Parse the YAML recipe file.
        generate(output_file: Path, overwrite: bool = True): Generate the README file.
