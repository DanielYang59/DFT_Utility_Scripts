In this example, the structure comprises three atoms: two Titanium (Ti) atoms and one Oxygen (O) atom.

## PDOS Curves Extraction

The PDOS extractor script has been utilized to extract three specific PDOS curves:

1. **Sum of d orbitals of both Ti atoms:** This curve represents the combined density of states for the d orbitals of both Titanium atoms.
2. **d`<sub>`xy`</sub>` orbital of the first Ti atom:** This curve specifically isolates the density of states associated with the d`<sub>`xy`</sub>` orbital of the first Titanium atom.
3. **Sum of p orbitals of O atom:** This curve illustrates the combined density of states for the p orbitals of the Oxygen atom.
